/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe how your firstIndexOf() method in BinarySearchDeluxe.java
 *  finds the first index of a key that equals the search key.
 *****************************************************************************/
We use a recursive search that halves its search range depending on the keyâ€™s 
relationship to the midpoint of the current search range. If the key is equal 
or less than the midpoint, the new range is the lower half of the current 
range. Otherwise, it is the upper half. Once there are two elements in the 
range, we use boolean logic to determine which element is the first index. 
This last step of determining the final result could have occurred when the 
recursive search method is applied to one element as both the lower and 
upper range if we coded two distinct search methods instead of one that could
be adapted for firstIndexOf() and lastIndexOf().

 *  What is the order of growth of the number of compares (in the

 *
 *  Recall that with order-of-growth notation, you should discard
 *  leading coefficients and lower order terms, e.g., M^2 + M log N.

from 2 * (log N) + 1 for search, M log M for mergesort of matching terms

numberOfMatches(): log N

Making a recursive binary search that could be easily adapted to look for both
first and last instances of given key. We could not determine an elegant way 
of finishing the recursive search that would work for both types of search.
